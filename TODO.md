# TODO List

- Add testing with [Pytest](https://pytest.org)
- Add a documentation website using [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org)

## Dependencies

- Create PR for [Rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io) for my changes to the
  `Prompt` class and hopefully get them merged. This is needed before the App
  can be published on [PyPi](https://pypi.org)
