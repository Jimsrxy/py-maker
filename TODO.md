# TODO List

- Add testing with [Pytest](https://pytest.org)
- Add a documentation website using [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org)
- Add option to generate a skeleton MkDocs website for the new project
- Implement saving settings to a file (Name, Email, Default License, etc.) Have
  a new command to create and edit the settings
- Ask for more settings ie homepage, repo, etc. and add them to the generated
  `pyproject.toml` file (if the new project is likely to be uploaded to PyPI)
